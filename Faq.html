    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): </h1>
     
    <h2>1: Why what this product line made? </h2>
    <p> This product line was made so that more durable razer gear can be sold. Razer does not condone raging at video games and taking it out on your hardware, and the intention is not for the gear to survive getting beaten up but instead lasting for a longer period of time under the same conditions that normal hardware would face on a daily basis. </p>
    
    <h2>2: What will be the prices of the new Rage Mode Gear?</h2>
    <p> We are aiming for prices between the chroma series gear and the non RGB gear, so for example the 'Razer Nari' with Chroma compatibility is £149 and the essential version is £99.99. Our Rage mode version will be £129.99 at release As it features a more durable material and also red LED's. </p>
    
    <h2>3: Can i get a free piece of gear please?</h2>
    <p> unfortunately we cannot give away pieces of our new line of gear for free as we have spent a lot of time and money on developing the technology to be able to make our gear more durable, which was one of the main complaints from the vast majority of people on our current gear. </p>
    
	<h2>4: I have spray painted my headset as you have instructed on your customizer page and it isn't working anymore, how do I fix it?</h2>
    <p> oh...uhm...yes. (Razer states within the terms of service that claims arising from any unacceptable use or care of the Product, including (without limitation) misuse, abuse, negligence, unauthorized modification or repair, unauthorized commercial use or any operation of the Product outside Razer's parameters)</p>
    
	<h2>5: There seems to be a lot of satire within this website, perhaps you should of taken this assignment a bit more seriously when applying the content within the pages. do you think so?</h2>
    <p> meh, at the point of reading this it is too late already so i guess we have both got to settle with the content there is. </p>
    
	<h2>6: Do you think that you are going to pass this module?</h2>
    <p> I hope so! </p>
    
	<h2>7: Is there anything you think you could of done to improve the website? </h2>
    <p> Looking at all of the pages now, I wish that I could come up with more content for the customizer page, but apart from the image which I did in the workshop on the 7th of January 2019, I couldn't think of anything else I could of put in that page. </p>
    
	<h2>8: What program did you use to construct the website?</h2>
    <p> I used the program known as brackets to construct the website. </p>
